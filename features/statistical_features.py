# features/statistical_features.py
"""
Computes statistical stretch/mean-reversion features from sep_base_common
with full coverage (no NULLs).

Features:
- close_zscore_21d: (close - mean_21) / std_21 with expanding fallbacks
- ret_1d_zscore_21d: ret_1d / std_21(ret_1d) with expanding fallback
- ret_1d_rank_21d: fast approximation via logistic CDF of z-score (0..1)
- price_pct_from_rolling_max_21d: (close - rolling_max_21) / rolling_max_21
- mean_reversion_flag: 1 if close_zscore_21d < -2.0 else 0

Run:
  python features/statistical_features.py --db-path data/kairos.duckdb

"""
Volume & volatility features from sep_base_common with full coverage.

Features:
- dollar_volume = close * volume
- vol_zscore_21d  (with expanding fallback + epsilon)
- volume_pct_change_1d  (safe when prev volume is 0/missing)
- ret_std_5d, ret_std_21d  (with expanding fallback)
- atr_14d  (True Range with prev close; 14-day SMA with expanding fallback)

Run:

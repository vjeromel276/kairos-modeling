# features/price_action_features.py
"""
Generates price action and momentum-based features from sep_base_common
with full coverage (no NULLs, no dropped rows).

Features:
- ret_1d, ret_5d, ret_21d  (backward-looking simple returns)
- hl_ratio, co_ratio
- true_range (high - low)
- range_pct  ((high - low) / open)

Run:
  python features/price_action_features.py --db-path data/kairos.duckdb
